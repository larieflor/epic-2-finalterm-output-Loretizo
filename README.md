Created this mandala using the online p5.js Web editor. I use simple design so that I can process its code in a basic way.
My design has no specific meaning but only a front view of a complex flower with lots of circles in different sizes.
I think starting with circles is a good start for me to learn more in this activity.
I would very much love to try new techniques in p5.js if there were no lockdown, such as creating moving pictures that has illusory effects.
Though It would be so much easier to learn if it were in a face to face setting.
I enjoyed learning and trying to process how this coding works. Though I only know a little but I think it's a good start.
